* In order not to specify event-incurring user, member must not exist. 
* For TOAST memberType, emailAddress is required, while userCode must not exist. 
* By contrast, for IAM memberType, userCode is required, while emailAddress must not exist. 
* idNO, if available, is to be applied beforehand, regardless of userCode or emailAddress. 
* Refer to the manual for information on eventId : [링크](http://docs.toast.com/en/CloudTrail/en/event-list/)
